<h1>Eryl Kenner</h1>
<p>
Eryl is a System Software Engineer with experience architecting, leading, and developing multiple software tools and frameworks for bare-metal and OS-based SoC validation. He is passionate about software engineering and prides himself on writing clean, maintainable code. He has diverse experience in areas such as validation, AI, embeddedÂ systems, and robotics, and continues to expand his software knowledge and tools in his free time through personal projects such as game development and machine learning.

I love to work on personal software projects in my free time, including several games I have built using the Unity game engine (including one which won 1st place in the Games category for the 2018 Reno's Biggest Little Hackathon event). I have also created my own game engine in C++ using the Ogre graphics engine, and have written a genetic algorithm in C++ that learns to play board games.
